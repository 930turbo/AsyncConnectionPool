# AsyncConnectionPool

This program creates a struct called ConnectionPool which holds a vector of connections, a sender for connection requests, and a receiver for connection releases. The connections are wrapped with an Arc (Atomically Reference Counted) and a Mutex (Mutual Exclusion), which allows for concurrent access and modification of the vector of connections. The Arc ensures that the data is shared across multiple threads and the Mutex ensures that only one thread can access and modify the vector at a time.

The new function creates a new connection pool with a given size and initializes the vector of connections, the sender, and the receiver. The channel is created using the mpsc::channel function which returns a sender and a receiver. The sender and receiver are then wrapped in Arc and Mutex to allow for concurrent access and modification.

The get_conn function sends a request for a connection through the sender and waits for a connection to be received through the receiver. The function creates a channel using the oneshot::channel function which returns a sender and a receiver. The request for a connection is sent through the sender and the function waits for the connection to be received through the receiver.

The release_conn function waits for a release request, then sends the connection back through the request channel. The function waits for a release request by calling `self.rx.lock().await.recv().await.unwrap(). This code uses the recvmethod on the receiver to wait for a release request. Thelock()method is used to acquire a lock on theMutex, ensuring that only one thread can access the receiver at a time. Once the release request has been received, the function sends the connection back through the request channel by calling tx.send(conn).unwrap()`.
